\chapter{Analysis of three aspects of modern countries: age, forms of government and ethno-horonyms}
\labch{country}


The chapter is devoted to the study of countries based on the knowledge base of the Wikidata international project. SPARQL queries were used in order to analyse and compare <<countries>> objects in Wikidata. A list of all currently existing countries, a list of countries ordered by date of creation, a list of demonyms of countries were generated. A bubble chart with the forms of government of countries and a graph of neighboring countries were constructed. In addition, conclusions were drawn regarding the completeness of the Wikidata for this topic.
