\chapter{Human settlements: Human settlements}

\labch{human-settlement}

This article explores the object of the Wikidata "human settlement" and its properties. The following problems were solved in the paper with the help of SPARQL requests:
finding instances of the object "human\_settlement", building an ordered list of countries by the total population, living in the "human\_settlement" and a list of objects 
that accompany the "human\_settlement" in the "instance" property. Also a graph was constructed, which show the proportion of the population living in "human settlement". 
The diagram shows that a high percentage of the population living in "human settlement", accounts for less industrial countries, while a small percentage of the population 
living in "human settlement" have industrialized countries. In addition, an analysis of the completeness of the Wikidata on the basis of solved tasks is performed. The property 
"instance\_of" was added to several objects to improve the results.
