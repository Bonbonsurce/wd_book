\chapter{From towns to cities with millions of inhabitants}
\labch{city}

The chapter is devoted to the study of different types of cities corresponding to the four objects of Wikidata â€” <<Town>>, <<City>>, <<Big city>> and <<City with millions of inhabitants>>. Using SPARQL-queries to Wikidata, data on the number of instances of the objects under study were obtained and issues related to the <<population>> and <<sister city>> properties of these Wikidata objects were considered. The following tasks have been solved: calculation and analysis of the population of different types of cities; determination of the number of cities without sister cities; construction a list of cities ordered by the number of sister cities; finding the number of cities with a certain amount of sister cities; determination of the country with most sister cities; finding the closest neighbours of Russia. In conclusion, an assessment of the completeness of the data presented in Wikipedia and Wikidata is given, and the problems and difficulties that have arisen when studying objects of different types of cities are listed.
