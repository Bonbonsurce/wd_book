There are several types of protection:
\begin{itemize}
\item Partial protection or half-protection (indicated by a gray lock) allows only auto-confirmed/confirmed participants to edit the page.
  \item Full protection (indicated by an orange or red lock) limits the circle of editors to administrators.
  \item Renaming protection (indicated by a green lock) does not limit the ability to edit the page, but only administrators can rename it. Most popular pages are protected from renaming. Rename protection cannot be applied to element or property pages.
  \item Creation protection (both full and partial protection is indicated by a blue lock) can be applied to deleted or non-existent pages. However, like rename protection, it cannot be applied to deleted elements or properties.
  \begin{itemize}
	\item With full protection from creation, no one can create a page except administrators.
	\item With partial protection from creation, the page can also be created by auto-confirmed and confirmed participants.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

In extremely rare cases, the Wikimedia Foundation can protect a page as an official action (\textit{office action}, indicated by a black lock). Official actions are carried out only as a result of a formal non-media complaint, are always publicly announced and are carried out only by employees of the Wikimedia Foundation or members of the Board of Trustees.
