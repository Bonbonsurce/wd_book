The chapter is devoted to research of spaceships and stations based on Wikidata. 
Using SPARQL scripts, a list of Russian ships and stations is constructed, 
a timeline of the launching of ships in our country and in the world for the period from 1960 to 2021 is drawn. 
An evaluation of the completeness of Wikidata was performed, showing, 
that many of the items have the wrong value of the property 
\wdProperty{31}{instance of}. In the course of the work, it was found that the current performance of Russian astronautics in terms of the number of spacecraft launches in recent years matches that of the USSR fifty years ago. 

\section{List of space ships and stations}
Let's build a query~\ref{lst:spaceships} to output a list of all spaceships and stations. 
We need the objects \wdqName{space station}{25956}, 
\wdqName{spacecraft}{40218} and the relation \wdProperty{31}{instance of}.

\section{Depth of object development}

As of 2021 on Wikidata \wdqName{Apollo-8}{184201} {wdqName} is the most complete and elaborate spacecraft, which has 30 properties.\autocite{spacecraftProWD} At the same time, only one property each has ships such as: \wdqName{Europa Astrobiology Lander}{10491365}, \wdqName{Project Orbiter}{6514453}, \wdqName{LRK}{5961734}, \wdqName{EarthForce One}{5327028}%
\sidenote[][]{%
Note the difficult fate of the object \wdqName{EarthForce One}{5327028}. This object was automatically created in Wikidata by a bot in 2013, because there was an English Wikipedia article. According to the <<\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EarthForce_One}{EarthForce One}>> English Wikipedia, the article was removed due to a lack of reliable sources proving the significance of the site. And the object has been left as an unremarkable item on Wikidata. Think of a query that would output a list of similar Wikidata items, that does not match any Wikipedia article.%
},%
\wdqName{GVC Union}{60767924}, %
\wdqName{CubeSat for Solar Particles}{22907583}.\autocite{spacecraftProWD} %
To find this information, a query built with the ProWD\autocite{spacecraftProWD} service was used. %
The same service showed that the number of properties of space objects is uneven, %
most are less than 30\% filled.\autocite{spacecraftProWD} %

\section{List of Soviet and Russian spaceships and stations}

Let us find ships and stations designed in USSR or Russia, using the query~\ref{lst:spaceshipsUSSR}.

\section{Analyzing the Completeness of Wikidata}

Let us analyze the degree of filling in Wikidata in the field of Soviet and Russian spaceships and stations.
By Query~\ref{lst:spaceships} 145 results were obtained for all ships and stations,
by Query~\ref{lst:spaceshipsUSSR} about Soviet and Russian objects~--- only 25.
Information about~Soviet and Russian objects in 2021
has become several times more compared to 2017,
when on Query~\ref{lst:spaceshipsUSSR} only 3 objects were returned.

As of 2021, the Buran.ru website in the section about the spaceships of the USSR and Russia contains information about 36 ships.\autocite{spacecraftBuran} %
There are 51 launches of spaceships from 1957 to 1984 in Soviet Union and 43 in same years in the United States.\autocite[480-483]{spacecraftCosmonavtika} This means that less than half of the Soviet spaceships are represented in Wikidata.
There are 10 Soviet and Russian launches of space stations\autocite[296]{spacecraftSAA},
126 NASA shuttle launches from 1981 to 2008\autocite[288]{spacecraftSAA}
and 31 international launch vehicles\autocite[290-291]{spacecraftSAA} in the American directory of space and astronomy.

\section{Time schedules of space exploration in Russia (include USSR) and the World}

Spacecraft launch schedule in Russia since 1960s (Figure~\ref{fig:launchesRussia5years})
built with Query~\ref{lst:launchesRussia5years}.%

Earlier, in queries to get any lists, we used the \wdProperty{31}{instance of} property.
The Query~\ref{lst:launchesRussia5years} without this property, we are using the relation
\wdProperty{619}{<< spaceship launch date >>} on line 10
for traversing and counting such objects that have been launched into space.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Exercise 1 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\label{question:spacecraft_1}%

}%
%
The logical operator \lstinline|UNION| on lines 5-8 in Query~\ref{lst:launchesRussia5years}
allows you to combine Soviet and Russian spacecraft launches.

If in the Query~\ref{lst:launchesRussia5years} instead of the variable \lstinline|?Lapse|~---\lstinline|?year| remained (lines 3 and 12),
then we would get in Figure~\ref{fig:launchesRussia5years}
the number of launches each year.
Thanks to the rounding function \lstinline|FLOOR()|
and grouping%
\sidenote[][8.0cm]{
%
On line 14 of the query,~\ref{lst:launchesRussia5years}
objects launched into space are grouped by the command:
\mbox {\lstinline|GROUP BY ?lapse|.} \newline
The fact that the grouping goes exactly according to five-year range, and not, for example, six-year-olds,
is defined on line 12, where the \lstinline|?year| divided by 5, rounded, and multiplied by 5.%
%
},
\lstinline|?item| objects that have launches are grouped over a five-year period,
and into the variable \lstinline|?quantity| the number of these objects is recorded,
calculated using the \lstinline|COUNT()| function.

The BarChart command in Query~\ref{lst:launchesRussia5years} is used to present the results as a bar chart in Figure~\ref{fig:launchesRussia5years}.

The horizontal axis in Figure~\ref{fig:launchesRussia5years} is answered by the variable \mbox{\lstinline|?lapse_str|}.

}, then the~X axis has a range from 0 to 2200, 
instead of the required range from 1960 to 2025, 
and the results are indicated by points with coordinates (five years, number of launches), 
and the graph becomes unreadable. 

The Figure~\ref{fig:launchesRussia5years} shows, 
that the most active period of Russian cosmonautics development was in 1970--1995.

The Query~\ref{lst:launchesWorld} draws Figure~\ref{fig:launchesWorld} 
of spacecraft launches in the World by year and country.

Figure~\ref{fig:launchesWorld} shows that the most spacecraft 
launched by India and the United States. 
(only they launched more than 10 annual launches) in 2017--2018. 
Worldwide launches peaked in 2018 (59 launches). 

According to Wikidata, Russian cosmonautics ranks average in the number of launches, 
its numbers for 2016--2019 are similar to those of the USSR in the 1970s and 1980s 
and about 3--5 launches per year.

For the Query~\ref{lst:internationalFlights} to work, you must specify the starting point~--- an astronaut who has participated in the international spaceflight. The starting point is set at line 11 of the Query~\ref{lst:internationalFlights} and written to the \mbox{\lstinline|?naut_seed|} variable. Next, at line 12, we search for astronauts who have flown with the one we specified earlier. Lines 15--17 load data about spacecraft, flights and astronauts. Boolean variable \lstinline|?toggle| has value \lstinline|?true| if the found object is a spacecraft or \lstinline|?false| if the found object is an astronaut. The selected object (spacecraft or astronaut) is written to the \lstinline|?item| variable in line 19. In line 20 the name of the object is written to the variable \lstinline|?itemLabel|, in line 21 the data for the coloring of ships is written to the variable \mbox{\lstinline|?rgb_source|}. 

If a ship is selected, then nothing is written to the variable \lstinline|?link| in line 22. If an astronaut is selected, then his ship is written to the variable~\lstinline|?link|. On the graph this variable will correspond to the arc from the astronaut to the ship. 

Line 23 loads the astronaut's citizenship data, and~ lines 26--34 assign a color to the vertices of the astronauts in the graph, depending on their citizenship.
