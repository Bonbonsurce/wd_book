\labch{bots}

This chapter examines the automation of processes in Wikidata. On many occasions we want 
to correct recurring errors or enter large amounts of data in Wikidata instead of modifying 
properties one by one. For data entry we have at our disposal several tools that facilitate our 
work, such as OpenRefine or QuickStatements, but repetitive modifications and insertions over 
time should be done with a bot.
